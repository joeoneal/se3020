## ZenStep Application

ZenStep is a mobile application designed to help users mindfully track their daily physical activity and emotional state. It integrates with the device's pedometer to display the current day's step count relative to a user-defined daily goal. Users can log their mood (Happy, Neutral, or Sad) throughout the day. The app features a history view to review past activity and mood logs, promoting reflection on patterns over time. Settings allow users to customize their daily step goal, switch between light and dark themes, and manage their stored data.

## Human Interface Guidelines Implementation

 **Clarity** is achieved through a clean visual hierarchy, prominently displaying the most important information – the daily step count and progress – using large, legible typography and a clear circular progress indicator. Standard SF Symbols (via Feather) are used for mood logging and navigation, providing instantly recognizable iconography. Interaction points like buttons and inputs are clearly defined, and the app supports both light and dark modes, respecting user preferences and ensuring readability in different environments.

The application also adheres to the principle of **Deference**, ensuring the UI supports the user's primary goal of tracking steps and mood without overshadowing the content. We utilize standard navigation patterns, including a bottom tab bar for primary sections (Today, History) and a modal presentation for the Settings screen, signaling a distinct, temporary task. **Feedback** is provided through visual cues, such as highlighting the selected mood and displaying confirmation alerts for destructive actions like clearing history. Consistent layout structure across the Today and History screens, along with the use of familiar controls, reinforces **Consistency** and predictability, making the app easier to learn and use.
